Each piece of bait you put out (such as ads, emails, landing pages, upsells, webinars, and phone calls) should include a hook, a story, and an offer.

## Your irresistible offer

### Three types of online busisness
1. You are selling a *physical* product. 
2. You are selling an *information* product. Digital courses, membership sites, live events and training.
3. You are selling a service. Restaurants, dentists, freelance coder.

If you currently fall into any of these three categories, you are likely selling what I call a “commodity.” My definition of a commodity is something that someone can also buy somewhere else.

### The first step is to increase the value of what you’re selling by creating an actual offer.
1. Increase the percieved value of what is beign sold.
2. Make the thing being sold unique to you and only available within this special offer.
3. The goal is to make the total value 10x more than what you are charging.

### Write down all the products and services you can add to your core offer
1. Brainstorm as many different ideas that you can come up with for other things that you could give your dream customer to help guarantee their success.
2. From those ideas, what elements could you take to create an irresistible offer?

## Story-Selling
A great offer is usually not enough on its own to produce a sale. You also need a *story* that helps your dream customers trust you enough to buy from you.

*There will be stories that you tell at every step in your funnel*. There will be a story in the ad that will get people to click on your ad. There will be a story on the landing page that will convince someone to take advantage of your first offer. There will be stories in the upsell pages, the webinar presentations you give, and more.

## The Hook
The hooks are the headlines, images, and videos that we put in front of our dream customers wherever they are congregating, with a goal to capture their attention just long enough that we can tell them our story.
