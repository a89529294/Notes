1. **Be goals**: The inner circle of purpose
2. **Do goals**: The middle circle of purpose
3. **Action goals**: The outer circle of purpose

*Be goals* are the values that guide our *action goals*, but the reverse is also true. If your *action goals* do not line up with your *be goals*, your *be goals* will be influenced.
