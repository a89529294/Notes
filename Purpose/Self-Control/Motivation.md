_Motivation_ is basically what gives positive or negative value to whatever we do.

## Two sources of motivation
- have-to: comes from the outside
- want-to: comes from within
if you have strong _want-to motivations_ for your goals, you will automatically experience _fewer obstacles and temptations_.

## How do we decide what to do?
Scientists believe that self-control is a value-based decision-making process.
When deciding between an option that yields an immediate reward (watching TV) and an option that yields a delayed reward (doing exercise), the brain first computes the subjective value of each option and then select the option with the highest positive value.
_If the value difference is large, thereâ€™s no need for self-control conflict._

## How do we increase the value difference between conflicting options?
There are two ways to do this. The first is to _reduce the value of the temptation_ (such as with reappraisal or commitment contracts). The second is to _increase your motivation for the thing you need to do_.

### increase motivation for things you need to do
- temptation bundling: e.g. only allowed to listen to music while doing chores
- self-rewarding: i.e. you do an intrinsically enjoyable activity only after completing your goal.
- look for an aspect within your activity that's immediately rewarding

### make temptation less fun
- reappraisal 
- commitment contract

## Summary
You should always aim to find some _want-to reasons for your goals_. This is the only way to persist in them in the long run.
