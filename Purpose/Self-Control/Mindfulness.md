## mindful eating
The idea behind mindful eating is to increase your _awareness of what you eat and how you eat it_. The technique teaches you to slowly focus on the sensations that you get while eating your meal (the color, shape, texture, scent, etc. of food) and to carefully examine the feelings which come before, during and after it.
