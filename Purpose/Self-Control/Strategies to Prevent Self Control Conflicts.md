## broad-bracketing
You consider the decision as _one of many_. In that case, you take into account the costs and benefits of a series of such decisions.

It’s very useful to get into the habit of broad-bracketing all of your decisions. Whenever you’re making a choice regarding food, exercise, expenses, ask yourself: _What are the costs and benefits of this decision if I make it every time from now on?_

## psychological connectedness: today is yesterday's tomorrow
Imagine yourself vividly as a person who’s 5, 10, 20 and 50 years older. Will you be a completely different person? Or will you have similar tastes and preferences?
If you connect to your future self this way, then you’ll realize that what you find tempting today, you’ll also likely find tempting tomorrow (and next month, next week and next year). Therefore, _if you indulge today, you’re probably going to indulge tomorrow_.

## adjusting your identity to avoid self control failure
Scientists have shown that people who have developed a _self-image around virtuous activities are more likely to identify and resolve self-control conflicts_.

Therefore, to successfully avoid buying the chocolate bar, you need to firstly identify yourself with the image of a strong-willed healthy-eating person. Secondly, you need to construe the act of buying or not buying as diagnostic of this self-identity. In this way, you’ll be motivated not to buy it in order to preserve a positive self-image.

## summary
- __broad-bracketing__: think of your choice (whether to indulge or not) not as a one-shot decision, but as a sequence of habitual decisions; always ask yourself: what will be the consequences if I indulge every time?
- __psychological connectedness__: realize that in the future you likely won’t change much – you’ll be equally tempted to indulge as you’re now and you won’t have more willpower or resources to deal with temptations than you have now ask yourself – _what would my older self ask me to do better now_ ?
- __adjusting your identity__: identify yourself with the self-image of a strong-willed person. Choose your identity based on your goals – if you want to become a runner, start thinking like one
