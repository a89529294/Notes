## Weekly/Daily Goals
1. Every Sunday, make a new to-do list called “Weekly Goals” with your goals for the week.
2. Every night, make a new to-do list called “Daily Goals”, based on the Weekly Goals and any extra smaller tasks and errands, as your goals for tomorrow.
3. When working, only focus on the Daily Goals. When you’re finished all of them, you’re done work for the day, no need to keep working.
