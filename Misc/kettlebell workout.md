Remember to start each workout with a 5-10 minute warm-up and end with a cool-down stretch to prevent injuries. Adjust the number of sets and reps based on your fitness level and comfort. As you progress, you can increase the weight of the kettlebell or add more sets/reps to keep challenging yourself. Stay hydrated and listen to your body, taking extra rest days if needed.
