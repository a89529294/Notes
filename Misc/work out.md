Remember to warm up with light cardio or dynamic stretches before each workout, and cool down with static stretches after your workouts. Listen to your body, and if you experience any pain or discomfort, modify exercises or seek guidance from a fitness professional. As you progress, you can adjust the number of sets and repetitions to suit your fitness level and goals. Consistency and proper form are key to seeing improvements in your deadlift over time.
