- In each mongo database, you can have multiple ***collections***; the equivalent of ***tables*** in SQL databases.
- In each collection, you can put ***documents*** in to it. 
- Unlike SQL **tables**, mongo **collections** do not by default enforce schema consistency, i.e. **documents** can look completely different.
- Default *mongo port* is `27017`, the connection string is `"mongodb://localhost:27017/orbit"`, the last segment is the database we intend to connect to.
