# What are sessions?
*Sessions* are a *server-side* data store to make HTTP stateful.
Compare this to *cookies* which are *client-side* data store to make HTTP stateful.
They are used in tandem; We store the data *server-side* then send the *client* a cookie that can be used to retrieve the data later on.
