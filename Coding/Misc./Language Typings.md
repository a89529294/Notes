## Strong Vs. Weak Typing
- *Strong/Weak* typing is about how **strictly** types are distinguished. 
- For example, whether the language does implicity coercion between types.

## Static Vs. Dynamic Typing
- *Static/Dynamic* typing is about **when** type information is acquired. i.e. at *compile* time or at *run* time.
