## What is Authentication?
**Authentication** is the process of verifying a user is who he say he is. 
Typically this is done with a *username/password* combo.

## What is Authorization?
**Authorization** is verifying what a specific user has access to.
Generally we *authorize* after a user has been *authenticated*. "Now that we know who you are, here is what you are allowed to do and NOT allowed to do"
