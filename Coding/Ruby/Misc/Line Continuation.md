```ruby
"a" "b" "c" # "abc"

"a" \
"b" \
"c" # "abc"
```

- Think of `\` as the opposite of `;`
- `\` lets one statement occupy two lines; `;` lets two statements occupy one line.
- Another way of thinking about `\` is it *prevents the line-break* from meaning that those two lines are different statements.
