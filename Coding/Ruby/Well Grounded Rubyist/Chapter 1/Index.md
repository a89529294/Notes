- The keyword *self* refers to the default object. Self is a role that different objects play, depending on the execution context. *Method calls that don’t specify a calling object are called on self.*

- Ruby sees all *data structures and values*—from simple scalar (atomic) values like integers and strings, to complex data structures like arrays—*as objects*.
	- `x = "100".to_i`
	- the *message* to the right of the dot is *sent* to the *object* to the left of the dot. 
	- In Ruby, it’s more correct to say you send a message to a receiving object, and the object executes the corresponding method.
	- `puts 'Hello'` we’re sending the *message* puts with the *argument* "Hello" to an object: the *default object self*.
	- There’s always a *self* defined when your program is running, although which object is self changes, according to specific rules.
- Ruby *Classes*
	- A class defines an object’s functionality, and every object is an instance of exactly one class.
	- objects can change, acquiring methods and behaviors that *weren’t defined in their class*.
	- The ability of objects to adopt behaviors that their class didn’t give them is one of the most central defining principles of the design of Ruby as a language.
- `ruby -cw file_name.rb` checks illegal syntax `-c` plus warn legal but questionable use of Ruby.
