## Git Blame (history of a single file)
- `git blame file1` it shows you *metadata* about the last revision of each line in a file based on `HEAD`
- `git blame commit_id file1` same as above, except it's based on `commit_id`

## Git Grep (searching git tracked files)
- `git grep pattern` print lines matching a pattern, in this case `word`, supports *regex*
- `git grep -i pattern` matches *case insensitively*
- `git grep -n pattern` display *line numbers*
- \*\* git only searches files that it is tracking!
- \*\* Look for specified patterns in the tracked files in the work tree, blobs registered in the index file. It can only be based on current commit.

## Git Log -S (searching diffs)
`git log -S pattern` Shows you the *commits* where `pattern` first appears or disappears in the *diff*
`git log -p -i --word-diff -S walnut` case-insensitive(`-i`) + show diff on a word level(`-p --word-diff`)
`git log -S pattern fileName` to limit search to *diffs* that involve *fileName*

## Git Log -G (searching diffs)
`git log -G pattern` Shows you *all* the commits where `pattern` shows up in the *diff*
`git log -p -i --word-diff -G walnut` accepts all the same flags as `git logs -S`

## Git Log --grep 
`git log --grep pattern` searches git *commit history* 

	## Git Bisect
workflow:
1. `git bisect start` to start
2. Then you tell git one bad commit and one good commit
	1. `git bisect bad` equivalent to `git bisect bad HEAD` 
	2. `git bisect good 6c19ac`
3. git will then *checkout* the middle commit
4. once again after running the application tell git whether the current commit is bad or good, `git bisect bad` or `git bisect good`
5. If it's good then the bad commit must be more recent than the current commit so git *checkouts a more recent commit*. If it's bad then the bad commit must be older or it could be the current commit so git *checkouts an older commit*.
6. When git runs out of commits to search it will tell you the *commit that introduces the bug*.
7. `git bisect reset` to exit
