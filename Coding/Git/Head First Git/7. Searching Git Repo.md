## Git Blame
- `git blame file1` it shows you *metadata* about the last revision of each line in a file based on `HEAD`
- `git blame commit_id file1` same as above, except it's based on `commit_id`

## Git Grep
- `git grep word` print lines matching a pattern, in this case `word`, supports *regex*
- `git grep -i word` matches *case insensitively*
- `git grep -n word` display *line numbers*
- \*\* git only searches files that it is tracking!
- \*\* Look for specified patterns in the tracked files in the work tree, blobs registered in the index file. It can only be based on current commit.

## Git Log -S
`git log -S word` Shows you the *commits* where `word` first appears or disappears
`git log -p -i --word-diff -S walnut` case-insensitive(`-i`) + diff on a word level(`-p --word-diff`)
