## Branches
> A branch is simply a reference to a commit via its ID. This reference is updated every time you make another commit on that branch.

> Every time you switch branches, Git rewrites your working directory to look like it did when you made the most recent commit on the branch you just switched to.

`git branch branch_name` creates a new branch
`git branch` lists all branches
`git switch branch_name` switch to another branch

## Getting help
`git command_name --help` man pages for git commands
`git comman_name -h` shorter man pages for git commands
`git help command_name` sam as `git command_name --help`

## Merging
Merging *feature* into *main* results in *main* having all the changes in both *main* & *feature*.

`git merge feature` merges feature into the current branch

There are two types of merges
1. **fast-forward merge**: When the feature branch you are merging back to the integration branch has all the changes in the integration branch already. No new commit is made.
2. *merge that creates a new commit*: When the integration branch contains changes not in the feature branch. Git will create a new commit to accomadate both changes. Possible conflicts need to be resolved. 

## Conflicts
You have four options when dealing with a conflict
1. Keep the changes in *branchA*
2. Keep the changes in *branchB*
3. Keep both (if possible)
4. Discard both and add something new

After modifying the conflicted file(s) `git add` them then `git commit`

## Deleting Branches
###### Deleting merged branches
`git branch -d branch_name` delete a branch, makes sure to switch to another branch first.

Remember a *branch* is just a *reference* to the latest *commit* on a branch, deleting it *removes that reference* but **DOES NOT** remove the commit, unless the commit becomes *unreachable*.

As long as a commit is *reachable*, i.e. another commit is pointing to it or a branch is referencing it, it will be kept around.
###### Deleting unmerged branches
You have to run `git branch -D branch_name` to force delete an *unmerged* branch.
The reason git tries to stop you is because if you delete an *unmerged* branch the commits on that branch becomes *unreachable* and will be deleted.

## Restoring a branch
`git branch branch_name commit_id` You can restore a deleted branch even if the commit it is based on is deleted. This is not limited to deleted branches or deleted commits, this command simply *creates a branch off of commit_id*.

## Typical Workflow
1. Base your new branches on commits on integration branch.
2. Merge back into integration branch once you are done.
3. Don't reuse branches. i.e. after merging back to integration branch, delete the feature branch.
