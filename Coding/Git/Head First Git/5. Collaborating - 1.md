Any commits that are pushed to the remote are now public commits. Once you push, you should *refrain from performing any operation that changes this history*: for example, don’t do a `git reset` or amend a commit message because they change the *commit id*. 

## Merging Branches When Collaboarting
Once you are done working on a branch, you have two options to merge your code into an integration branch:
1. The first option is to merge into an integration branch *locally*, then push the integration branch to the remote.
2. The second option is “*merging in public*” where you use the Git repository to perform a merge. GitHub offers “*pull requests*” to perform merges. Also called "*merge requests*" in Gitlab.

If you choose to "*merge in public*", here are the steps
1. push the local branch to the remote by `git push -u origin local_branch_name` if remote does not know about the local branch. `git push` if the remote knows about the local branch.
2. Issue a pull request by picking a *target/base* branch and a  *source* branch. Target/base is the branch to merge into.
