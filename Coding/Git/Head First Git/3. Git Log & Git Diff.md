## Git Log
`git log --oneline --all --graph` : show graph for all branches
`git log --oneline`: show log for current branch

## Git Diff
`git diff` compares the version that Git has in its _index_ with the version of the file in the _working directory_. It shows the differences one file at a time, seperated into *hunks*. You will see lines starting with `@@` that is called a *hunk header*.

Any time you see lines prefixed with `-` or multiple `-` it means the *old* version or version `a`. When you see lines prefixed with one or more `+` it means the *new* version or version `b`

`git diff` compares the version that Git has in its _index(old)_ with the version of the file in the _working directory(new)_.
`git diff --cached` compares the version in *object db(old)* to the version in *index(new)*. Same as `git diff --staged`
`git diff target_commit source_commit` compares two *commits*, they can be branches *as* well since branches are just references to the latest commits. `target_commit` will be the *old version*/*version a*, `source_commit` will be the *new version*/*version b*.
