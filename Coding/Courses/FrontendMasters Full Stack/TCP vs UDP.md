**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
    - Connection-oriented protocol.
    - Provides _reliable, ordered, and error-checked_ delivery of data packets over a network.
    - Establishes a connection between sender and receiver before data transfer.
    - Guarantees delivery and ensures that data packets arrive in the correct order.
    - Uses acknowledgments, retransmissions, and flow control mechanisms to ensure reliability.
    - Suitable for applications where data integrity and order are crucial, such as _web browsing, email, and file transfer (FTP)_.

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:
    - Connectionless protocol.
    - Provides _fast, lightweight, and unreliable delivery_ of data packets over a network.
    - Does not establish a connection before data transfer and does not guarantee delivery or order of packets.
    - Does not use acknowledgments or retransmissions, leading to lower overhead and faster transmission.
    - Suitable for real-time applications where speed is more important than reliability, such as _streaming media, online gaming, and VoIP (Voice over IP)_.
