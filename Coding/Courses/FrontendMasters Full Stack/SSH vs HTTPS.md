The process of establishing an SSH connection does share several similarities with establishing an HTTPS connection, particularly in the initial steps of secure communication setup. Let's break down both protocols to highlight the similarities and differences:

### HTTPS Connection

1. **Server Authentication:**
    - When a client (typically a web browser) initiates an HTTPS connection to a server, the server sends its SSL/TLS certificate to the client.
    - The certificate includes the server's public key and is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
    - The client verifies the server's identity by checking the certificate's validity and the CA's signature.
2. **Session Key Establishment:**
    - Using a key exchange mechanism (such as Diffie-Hellman or RSA), the client and server securely establish a shared session key.
    - This session key is used for symmetric encryption during the session.
3. **Data Encryption:**
    - All subsequent communication between the client and server is encrypted using the established symmetric session key.

### SSH Connection

1. **Server Authentication:**
    - The server sends its public key to the client when the client initiates an SSH connection.
    - The client verifies the server's identity using the server's public key, often checking against a known_hosts file.
2. **Session Key Establishment:**
    - SSH uses a key exchange algorithm (like Diffie-Hellman) to securely establish a shared session key.
    - This session key is used for symmetric encryption during the session.
3. **Client Authentication:**
    - The client authenticates itself to the server. Common methods include:
        - **Password Authentication:** The client sends a password to the server (encrypted using the session key).
        - **Public Key Authentication:** The client signs a challenge with its private key, and the server verifies it with the client’s public key (stored in the server’s authorized_keys file).
4. **Data Encryption:**
    - All subsequent communication is encrypted using the established symmetric session key.

### Key Similarities:

1. **Initial Authentication:**
    - Both protocols start with server authentication to ensure the client is communicating with the correct server.
    - Public key infrastructure (PKI) is used in both cases to verify the server's identity.
2. **Session Key Establishment:**
    - Both HTTPS and SSH use key exchange algorithms to securely establish a shared symmetric session key.
    - This session key is used for encrypting the data transmitted during the session.
3. **Symmetric Encryption for Data Transmission:**
    - Once the session key is established, both protocols use symmetric encryption for efficient and secure data transfer.

### Key Differences:

1. **Client Authentication:**
    - **HTTPS:** Client authentication is optional and less common. When required, it's usually implemented using client certificates.
    - **SSH:** Client authentication is mandatory and commonly involves password or public key authentication.
2. **Usage Context:**
    - **HTTPS:** Primarily used for secure communication over the web (e.g., between web browsers and servers).
    - **SSH:** Used for secure remote login, command execution, and file transfers between a client and a server.
3. **Public Key Verification:**
    - **HTTPS:** The server's public key is embedded in a certificate signed by a CA, which the client verifies against a list of trusted CAs.
    - **SSH:** The server's public key is directly verified by the client, often against a known_hosts file, without relying on external CAs.

### Summary

While both HTTPS and SSH use similar mechanisms for establishing secure connections (server authentication, key exchange, and symmetric encryption), SSH includes an additional mandatory step for client authentication and is designed for secure remote operations. HTTPS is primarily designed for secure web communication and typically focuses on server authentication.
