## Three modes
### insert (text editing)
to enter press `i`
### normal (primary)
to enter press `Esc`
### command (searching, saving, exiting)
to enter press `:`

Remember you can only enter other modes in _normal mode_.

## tips
- To undo a change, `Esc` then `u`.
- `:wq` to save then quit
- `:q!` to force quit, usually done to avoid saving
