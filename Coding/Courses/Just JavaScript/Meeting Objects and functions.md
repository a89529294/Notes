There is one thing in particular that makes objects exciting and unique. **We can make more of them! We can populate our JavaScript universe with our own objects.** Every time we use the `{}` object literal, we _create_ a brand new object value.

In our mental model, all of the primitive values we’ve discussed—`null`, `undefined`, booleans, numbers, and strings—have “always existed.” We can’t create a new string or a new number, we can only “summon” that value.

`function() {}` is an expression. Like any expression, a function expression is a “question” to our JavaScript universe—**which answers us by _creating_ a new function value every time we ask**. This is very similar to how `{}` creates a new object value when it executes. Functions are like objects!

**Generally speaking, if you can do something to an object, you can also do that to a function too. They are very special objects.**

###### Summary
Primitive values (strings, numbers, etc...), which we encountered in the first part of our tour, have always existed in our universe. **For example, writing `2` or `"hello"` always “summons” the same number or a string value. Objects and functions behave differently and allow us to generate our own values. Writing `{}` or `function() {}` always _creates_ a brand new, different value.**
