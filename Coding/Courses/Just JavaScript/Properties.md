Properties are *wires*—a bit like variables. They both point to values. Unlike variables, properties **start from objects** in our universe.

Importantly, properties don’t _contain_ values—they _point_ to them! Remember that our universe is full of wires. Some of them start from our code (variables), and others start from objects (properties). *All wires always point to values*.
