A *version control system*
- tracks and manages changes to files over time.

## git config file
`nano ~/.gitconfig`

## git repo
a *git repo* is a workspace which tracks and manages files within a `.git` folder. 
use `git init` to turn a directory into a `git` repo by creating a `.git` folder.
**DO NOT run git init** inside a git repo! Before you `git init`, always check with `git status` first.

## keep commits atomic
When possible, a *commit* should encompass a single feature, change, or fix. 

## keep commit message in imperative
As if you are *giving commands* to the code base.
