## Iaas v.s. Paas
- _IaaS_ is like renting virtualized hardware where you have control over the infrastructure, including operating systems and software configurations.
- _PaaS_ is like renting a fully managed platform for application development and deployment, where you can focus solely on writing code and building applications without worrying about infrastructure management.

In more details:
1. *Infrastructure as a Service* (IaaS): IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. With IaaS, you have control over the underlying infrastructure, such as virtual machines (VMs), storage, and networking. It gives you the flexibility to manage and configure these resources as needed. Think of IaaS as renting virtualized hardware where you are responsible for installing and managing the operating system, middleware, and applications.
    
2. _Platform as a Service_ (PaaS): PaaS, on the other hand, provides a platform and environment for developing, deploying, and managing applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. It abstracts away the complexity of infrastructure management, allowing you to focus solely on building and running your applications. PaaS providers handle the underlying infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking, while you can focus on writing code and deploying your application.
