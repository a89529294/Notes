There are two common approaches for interacting with a database:
- Using the databases' native query language, such as *SQL*.
- Using an Object Data Model ("ODM") or an Object Relational Model ("ORM"). *An ODM/ORM represents the website's data as JavaScript objects, which are then mapped to the underlying database*. Some ORMs are tied to a specific database, while others provide a database-agnostic backend.
