- `currentColor` is always a reference to the element's derived text color (whether set explicitly or inherited), and it can be used anywhere a color might be used
- `border` vs `outline` The core difference is that _outline doesn't affect layout_. 
	- Outlines are stacked outside border. 
	- Outlines will follow the curve set with `border-radius`
	- Outlines have a special `outline-offset` property. It allows you to add a bit of a gap between the element and its outline.
