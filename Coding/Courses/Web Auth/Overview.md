Three *authentication implementation* options:
1. custom auth: username/password, WebAuthn
2. identity providers: OpenID, SAML, sso
3. identity as a service: Auth0

## WebAuthn
The Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) is an extension of the [Credential Management API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Credential_Management_API) that enables strong authentication with public key cryptography, enabling password less authentication and secure multi-factor authentication (MFA) without SMS texts.

## Security Risks
- man in the middle attacks
- keyloggers
- easy to guess passwords
- web servers and db attacks
- phishing and social engineering attacks
