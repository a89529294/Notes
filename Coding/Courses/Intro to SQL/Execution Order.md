## order of execution vs written order
_written order_
```sql
SELECT ...
FROM ...
JOIN ... 
ON ...
WHERE ...
GROUP BY ...
HAVING ...
ORDER BY ...
LIMIT ...
OFFSET ...
```
_execution order_
`FROM` ->`JOIN/ON` -> `WHERE` -> `GROUP BY`  -> `HAVING` -> `SELECT` -> `ORDER BY` -> `LIMIT/OFFSET`

## explanation
		1. **FROM**: Specifies the tables or data sources from which data will be retrieved.
1. **WHERE**: Filters rows based on conditions. This reduces the set of rows that will be considered for aggregation.
2. **GROUP BY**: Groups the filtered rows into sets based on one or more columns. The grouping defines how the data will be aggregated.
3. **HAVING**: Filters groups of rows based on aggregate values. Groups that don't meet the HAVING criteria are excluded. This is where you apply _aggregate functions_ to filter out groups.
4. **SELECT**: Specifies which columns or expressions to include in the result set. This is where you apply _aggregate functions_ to perform calculations on the grouped data.
5. **DISTINCT**: Removes duplicate rows from the result set.
6. **ORDER BY**: Sorts the rows in the result set based on specified columns.
7. **LIMIT/OFFSET (or FETCH/FIRST)**: Limits the number of rows returned and specifies a starting point within the sorted result set.
8. **UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT**: Combines or compares result sets, if applicable.
