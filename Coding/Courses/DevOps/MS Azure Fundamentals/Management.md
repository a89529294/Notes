## Azure Advisor
Azure Advisor evaluates your Azure resources and makes _recommendations to help improve reliability, security, and performance, achieve operational excellence, and reduce costs_.

## Azure Service Health
Azure Service Health helps you _keep track of Azure resource, both your specifically deployed resources and the overall status of Azure_. Azure service health does this by combining three different Azure services:
- **Azure Status** is a broad picture of the status of Azure globally.
- **Service Health** provides a narrower view of Azure services and regions. It focuses on the Azure services and regions you're using.
- **Resource Health** is a tailored view of your actual Azure resources.

## Azure Monitor
Azure Monitor is a _platform for collecting data on your resources, analyzing that data, visualizing the information, and even acting on the results_. Azure Monitor can monitor Azure resources, your on-premises resources, and even multi-cloud resources like virtual machines hosted with a different cloud provider.
