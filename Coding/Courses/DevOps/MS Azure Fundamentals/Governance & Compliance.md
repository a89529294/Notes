## Microsoft Purview
Two main solution areas comprise Microsoft Purview: **risk and compliance** and **unified data governance**.

## Azure Policy
Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables you to _create, assign, and manage policies_ that control or audit your resources.

Azure Policy enables you to define both individual policies and _groups of related policies, known as initiatives_.

_Azure Policies are inherited_, so if you set a policy at a high level, it will automatically be applied to all of the groupings that fall within the parent.

## Resource Lock
A resource lock prevents resources _from being accidentally deleted or changed_.

_Resource locks are inherited_, meaning that if you place a resource lock on a resource group, all of the resources within the resource group will also have the resource lock applied.

There are _two types of resource locks_, one that prevents users from deleting and one that prevents users from changing or deleting a resource.

- _read only lock_ you can only read, no update or delete allowed
- _delete lock_ you cannot delete this resource

## Service Trust Portal
The Microsoft Service Trust Portal is a portal that provides access to various content, tools, and other resources about _Microsoft security, privacy, and compliance practices_.
