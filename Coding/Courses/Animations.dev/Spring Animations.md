Mass:
- *Primarily affects the velocity and acceleration response*
- Higher mass = slower velocity changes (more inertia)
- Lower mass = quicker velocity changes
- *Indirectly affects duration since slower velocity changes mean longer settling time*

Stiffness:
- *Directly affects both velocity and amplitude*
- Higher stiffness = higher initial velocity and amplitude
- Lower stiffness = lower initial velocity and amplitude
- Like the "power" or "force" of the spring
- A very stiff spring will pull/push with more force, creating faster movement

Damping:
- *Controls how quickly velocity and amplitude decrease over time*
- Higher damping = faster velocity reduction and amplitude decay
- Lower damping = slower velocity reduction, maintaining amplitude longer
- *Directly affects duration since it determines how quickly the motion settles*
- Zero damping would result in perpetual oscillation
