## ease-out
This is the curve I use the most in my UI work. It's great for user-initiated interactions like opening a modal as the acceleration at the beginning gives the user a feeling of responsiveness. *I apply this easing for most enter and exit animations.*

## ease-in-out
Starts slowly, speeds up and then slows down towards the end, like a car. This is the most satisfying curve to look at in my opinion. *I use it for anything that is already on the screen and needs to move to a new position, or morph into a new form.*

## ease-in
It's the opposite ofÂ `ease-out`, it starts slowly and ends fast. Due to its slow start, *it should generally be avoided as it can make interfaces feel sluggish and less responsive.*

## linear
The only time I would use linear is for a *loading spinner or other continuous animations where there are no interactions*.

## understanding cubic bezier
![[cubic-bezier.png]]
1. p1 is fixed at (0,0), p4 is fixed at (1,1)
2. x-axis represents time, y-axis represents displacement
3. (p2-x, p2-y,p3-x,p3-y)
4. p2 and p3 x coord is restricted between 0 and 1, y coord has no such restriction
5. (0,500,1,500) creates a parabolic curve, (0.5,500,0.5,-500) creates a sinusoidal curve.
