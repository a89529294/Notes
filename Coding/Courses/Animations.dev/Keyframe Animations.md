## __When to se keyframe animations__

- You need infinite loops (marquee, spinner)
- The animation runs automatically (intro animation on a page)
- You need multiple steps/states (pulse animation)
- Simple enter or exit transitions that don't need to support interruptions (dialog, popup)

## __When to use CSS transitions__

- User interaction triggers the change (hover, click, etc.)
- You need smooth interruption handling (Sonner)
