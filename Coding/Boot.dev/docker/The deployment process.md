1. The developer (you) writes some new code
2. The developer commits the code to Git
3. The developer pushes a new branch to GitHub
4. The developer opens a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to the `main` branch
5. A teammate reviews the PR and approves it (if it looks good)
6. The developer merges the pull request
7. Upon merging, an automated script, perhaps a [Github action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), is started
8. The script builds the code (if it's a compiled language)
9. The script builds a new docker image with the latest program
10. The script pushes the new image to Docker Hub
11. The server that runs the containers, perhaps a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster, is told there is a new version
12. The k8s cluster pulls down the latest image
13. The k8s cluster shuts down old containers as it spins up new containers of the latest image
