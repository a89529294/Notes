We've been throwing around the terms "docker image" and "docker container", let's take a step back and make sure we understand what these terms mean.

- A "docker image" is the read-only _definition_ of a container
- A "docker container" is a virtualized read-write environment

_A container is essentially just an image that's actively running._
