A **queue** is just an implementation of a **linkedList**

*FIFO* first in first out

We define the `head` of a linkedList to be the first element to  be removed so in a **queue** the `head` would be the *first element*. The direction is from head to tail which dictates where `next` is pointing.

In the case of a **queue** `next` would be pointing from *start* of the **queue** towards the *end*.
