**Big O** is a way of categorizing your algorithm's time or memory requirements based on *input*. It is meant to generalize the *growth* of your algorithm.

## Important Concepts
1. *Growth* is with respect to *input*
2. *Constants* are dropped. **Big O** only cares about the shape of the growth. e.g. linear growth is still linear growth no matter the constant; exponential growth is still exponential growth no matter the constant.
3. We often only care about the *worst case*.
