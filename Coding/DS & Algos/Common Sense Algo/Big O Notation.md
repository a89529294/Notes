- **Big O Notation** generally refers to *worst-case scenario* unless specified otherwise.
- O(1) simply means that the algorithm takes the *same number of steps* no matter how much data there is.
- O(N) *for N elements* inside an array, the algorithm would *take N steps* to complete.
- It ignores constants.
- The purpose of Big O is that for different classifications, there will be a point at which one classification supersedes the other in speed, and will remain faster forever.
- the main takeaway of this chapter is that when two algorithms fall under the same classification of Big O, it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that both algorithms process at the same speed.
