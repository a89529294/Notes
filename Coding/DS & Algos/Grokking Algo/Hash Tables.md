A *hash function* is a function where you put in a string and get back a number.
- It has to be consistent, if you put in `'apple'` and get back `4`, everytime you put in `'apple'` you need to get back `4`.
- It should map different words to different numbers.

Put a *hash function* and an *array* together and you get a **hash table**.
