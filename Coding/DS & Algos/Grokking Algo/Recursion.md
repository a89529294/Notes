Every *recursive* function has two parts: the base case and the recursive case.

## Divide & Conquer
- A recursive technique for solving problems.
- steps
	- Figure out a simple case as the base case
	- Figure out how to reduce your problem to get to the base case.
- If you are using *D&C* on a list, the base case is probably an empty array of an array with one element.
