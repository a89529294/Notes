Finds the *shortest distance* between two things
- Write a checkers AI that calculates the fewest moves to victory.
- Write a spell checker, fewest edits from your misspelling to a real word.
- Find a doctor closest to you in you network.

## What does BFS tell you?
- If there is a path from A to B.
- If there is, what is the shortest path.

## What is a Graph
A *graph* models a set of connections. Each graph is made up of *nodes* and *edges*.
A *tree* is a graph where no *edges* every point back.

### Watch out!
- Make sure you don't check the same item again, otherwise you might end up in an infinite loop.
