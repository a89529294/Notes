- ***Compiling*** refers to the process of taking code in *one language* and **outputting** it in *another language* or another version of that language.
- ***Minification*** is the process of *removing* unnecessary code formatting and comments without changing the code’s functionality. 
- ***Bundling*** is the process of resolving the web of dependencies and merging (or ‘packaging’) the files (or modules) into *optimized bundles* for the browser, with the goal of reducing the number of requests for files when a user visits a web page.
- ***Code-splitting*** is the process of *splitting* the application’s bundle into *smaller chunks* required by each *entry point*. The goal is to improve the application's initial load time by only loading the code required to run that page.
