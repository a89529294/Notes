- For _numeric_ data types, most DBMS has two types
	- INTEGER
	- DECIMAL(precision, scale): precision represents the *maximum number of digits* in the number and scale represents the *exact number of digits after the decimal point*.
- **NULL** value in SQL
	- *Arithmetic* or *string expressions* with **NULL** among the operands are evaluated as **NULL**, `2 + NULL` results in NULL.
	- *Comparisons* when at least one of the operands is **NULL** results in **UNKNOWN** or **NULL** depending on the DBMS, `NULL > 1` results in NULL/UNKNOWN
	- Use `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` to check whether an expression or value is **NULL**, `1 is NULL` results in FALSE. 
	- In DBMS that has `UNKNOWN`, it is actually the NULL value of boolean type, so you have **TRUE**, **FALSE** and **UNKNOWN**.
- AGGREGATE functions
	- For `COUNT()` there are three cases:
		- `COUNT(col)` counts number of cell values that are not null
		- `COUNT(*)` counts number of rows
		- `COUNT(DISTINCT col)` counts number of unique cell values that are not null
