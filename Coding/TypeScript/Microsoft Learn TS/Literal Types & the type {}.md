There are three sets of *literal types*: `number`, `string`, `boolean`.

Any number is a literal type of `number`.
Any string is a literal type of `string`.
`true`/`false` are literal types of `boolean`.

Reminder that *primitives* in JS are *immutable*.

type `{}` can be assigned anything except `null` and `undefined`.
