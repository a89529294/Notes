- Node.js JavaScript runtime is a wrapper around a JavaScript engine called V8.
- Node.js is based on a *single-threaded event loop*.
	- _Single-threaded_ means that JavaScript has only one call stack and can do only one thing at a time.
	- The _event loop_ runs the code, collects and processes events, and runs the next subtasks in the event queue.
