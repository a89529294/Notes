“Ultimately, the business that can spend the most to acquire a customer wins. A business beats its competition by making the same prospect worth more to his business than to that of his competition.”

## What is the difference between a website and a funnel?
Most **websites** have so many buttons, so many calls to action, and so many menus leading to hundreds of different pages.

A **funnel**, on the other hand, is created to be simple. From the outside, it may look like a website, but you’ll notice that each page and each step only has one call to action.

## What to do after a user gets on your funnel?
1. I take someone to a page that only has one goal: to get their name and contact information. From there, I take those people who became leads into a sales process to sell the one product or service they are looking for.
2. After they make the purchase, customize the order for them through an upsell process.
3. Each page is simple, has a hook that will grab your attention, tells a story to create value, and makes you an offer that will move you to the next page of the funnel.
