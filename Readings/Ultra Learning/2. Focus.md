The three struggles of focus: _starting_, _sustaining_, and _optimizing_
## Starting
Make a _mental habit of every time you procrastinate_; try to recognize that you are feeling some desire not to do that task or a stronger desire to do something else. You might even want to ask yourself which feeling is more powerful in that momentâ€”is the problem more that _you have a strong urge to do a different activity_ (e.g., eat something, check your phone, take a nap) or that _you have a strong urge to avoid the thing you should be doing_ because you imagine it will be uncomfortable, painful, or frustrating?
### having a strong urge to AVOID
Start by telling yourself that you only need to do the activity for five minutes. 
Once you are accustomed to only doing it for 5 minutes switch to _pomodoro_.
## Sustaining
### distraction source one: environment
Are you accessing the internet, watching television, or playing games? Are there distracting noises and sounds? Are you prepared to work, or might you need to stop to look for pens, a book, or a lamp?
### distraction source two: your task
When the task is too mentally challenging, a good idea is to write something down or try to go over the concepts out loud.
### distraction source three: your mind
Learn to let it arise, note it, and release it.
## Optimizing
Find a quiet place and focus, sometimes taking a break can allow for new ideas.
