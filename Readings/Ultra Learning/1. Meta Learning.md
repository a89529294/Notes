## why
The projects you take on are going to have one of two broad motivations: _instrumental_ and _intrinsic_.
_Instrumental learning projects_ are those you’re learning with the purpose of achieving a different, non learning result.
_Intrinsic projects_ are those that you’re pursuing for their own sake.

## what
A good way to do this is to write down on a sheet of paper three columns with the headings “Concepts,” “Facts,” and “Procedures.”

### concepts
Concepts are ideas that you need to understand in flexible ways in order for them to be useful.
### facts
Anything that needs to be memorized.
### procedures
Anything that needs to be practiced. Procedures are actions that need to be performed and may not involve much conscious thinking at all.

## how
Find a default curriculum or roadmap, then tailor it to your needs.
